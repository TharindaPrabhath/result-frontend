## Overview

This result platform was built to present the exam results of examinees. Examinees can view their results by visiting the platform via the web and entering their index number. Currently, this platform is only responsible for handling the presenting part of the results. Yet, there is no admin panel created for handling the CRUD operations with the database. But I have successfully integrated the platform with third parties and used a custom script (written by myself) to upload the result sheets to the db.

## Features
- View results of the examinees
- Leaderboard
- Downloadable resources related to the exam

## Demo
This is a real-world usage of this platform [Visit](https://result-frontend-htdrr54r9-tharindaprabhath.vercel.app/).

## Installation

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to interact with the platform.
